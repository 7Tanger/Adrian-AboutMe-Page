        <p><img src="img/picture.jpg" alt="pic"> </p>
        <p class="white-text">My journey to becoming a software engineer is fueled by my passion for technology and innovation. At just 14 years old, I have already set a clear career goal to excel in the field of software engineering. To achieve this, I plan to take computer science classes and perform exceptionally well in them. This dedication to learning and mastering computer science is driven by my genuine love for the subject. I believe that pursuing a career in software engineering will not only be fulfilling but also enjoyable. With a strong commitment to my goals, I am on the path to turning my passion into a successful career.</p>
        <p class="white-text">One of my strengths is coding in Lua and some JavaScript. I am pretty organized, which helps me manage my tasks efficiently. I always try to complete my work as quickly as possible so I don’t have to deal with it later. However, one of my weaknesses is accuracy, which is why I don’t always excel in computer science. Despite this, I am constantly working on improving my precision. I believe that with more practice and attention to detail, I can overcome this challenge.</p>
        <p class="white-text">I don’t have any significant accomplishments from high school yet since I just started. However, participating in team sports has been a major character-building experience for me. It has taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Through sports, I’ve learned how to handle both victories and defeats gracefully. These experiences have shaped my personality and helped me develop a strong work ethic. I am confident that these qualities will serve me well in my high school journey and beyond.</p>
